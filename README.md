## 🎨 Signature Motion Language

### **Easing Curves**
```typescript
power: [0.19, 1, 0.22, 1]      // Powerful entrances - immediate impact
cinematic: [0.83, 0, 0.17, 1]  // Dramatic reveals - builds tension
organic: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]  // Natural phenomena - flowing motion
luxe: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]        // Luxurious reveals - anticipation
```

### **Animation Variants**
- **Cinematic**: Dramatic reveals with blur and perspective
- **Organic**: Individual letter timing with natural variation  
- **Bounce**: Playful spring-physics interactions
